Add Relevant Skills to the skill section and take the info from the Job Description
For Summery Keep it Clean and relevant to the Job Description
While writing the Projects keep this in mind How write about the Projects :- (What you did and How you did it e.g. Framework, Technology, Tool. Example:- Data Engineering: Build a lager and custom Datasets by implementing fetcher and preprocessing units to periodically retrieve data)
DON‚ÄôT CHANGE INFO SUCH AS Name, number, address, email_link, linkedin_link, Personal_site, github, companyName, location, timeFrame, Education
Keep the Experience 1 year in Summary
Pls add enough information that it will not look and feel Short.
there are only 3 section to keep in mind
